# Amazon-Web-Scraping

Scraped product data from Amazon using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. The data is stored in a CSV file and is used for tracking price changes over time. 

This project also includes the code for how you can email yourself whenever the product's price meets a certain requirement.

Product I used: [Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B09XSDMT4F)
